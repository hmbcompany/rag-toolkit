"""
Simple example showing how to use RAG Toolkit with a basic RAG pipeline.

This example demonstrates:
1. Setting up a mock RAG pipeline
2. Using the @trace decorator
3. Manual context addition
4. Running the pipeline and viewing traces

To run this example:
1. Start the RAG Toolkit API: `uvicorn ragtoolkit.api.main:app --reload`
2. Run this script: `python examples/simple_rag_example.py`
3. Check the dashboard at http://localhost:8000 to see your traces
